      <h2>What is the Internet of Things?</h2>
        <p>The Internet of Things refers to the increasing amount of household objects such as refrigerators or mirrors which are capable of transferring data via the internet / communication networks. (Meola, 2018)</p>
        <p>IoT has become increasingly more prevalent with new technologies such as the decreasing size of chips and the prevalence of Wi-Fi enabled technologies allow for more devices to be potentially IoT compatible, as per Moore's Law which predicts that the size of transistors shrink by half every eighteen or so months. (Simonite, 2016)</p>
      <h3>Why might this be useful?</h3>
        <p>The IoT allows for the automation of everyday tasks such as turning on lights or boiling the kettle. This gives the user the ability to relax and connect to the entire house through one's phone or tablet. Devices like smart fridges allow for easy access to recipes and the internet to research cooking skills or techniques.</p>
        <p>Not only do they pose as a way of simplifying life, they can also help to protect it. Most Home Assistants (hubs like Amazon Alexa or Google Home) allow you play noises like barking when you are away from home. These features alongside the automation of lights, blinds etc. They give the illusion that you are home, deterring potential threats. (Telefónica, 2018)</p>
        <p>Another benefit of the Internet of Things is its potential applications in the medical field. Devices like smart watches constantly monitor statistics such as heartbeat and movement. Doctors could use this data when diagnosing patients with illnesses such as type 2 diabetes. (Shekhtman, 2018)</p>

      <h2>Social and Ethical Issues</h2>
        <h3>Social Transformation</h3>
          <p>By increasing the ease of access to the internet and by automating tasks that would typically be completed manually, people are encouraged to do as little as possible. While this is ideal in theory, it encourages a future that parallels the extremes of WALL-E, in which society is entirely dependent on technology to the point where they are incapable of walking without chairs restricted to travelling on designated paths. (Acharya, 2016) The Internet of Things is an excellent resource, but one must be vigilant to ensure that we do not take it for granted.</p>
        <!--Insert Picture of Dash Buttons-->
          <p>Take Amazon Dash buttons for example, which allow you to instantly reorder select products when you are running low at the press of a button. This encourages the user to stay at home rather than go for a walk to the shops when running low on supplies. (Wong, 2015) By doing this, people with little motivation to go outside now have even less. It also encourages brand loyalty which, while not necessarily bad, can create hive-minds of devotion to a particular product which can inhibit demand for better products and alienate persons by creating rifts between opposing brands. (Henry, 2015) </p>
        <h3>Security Flaws</h3>
<!-- Link to data collection DC where it says Data Collection -->
          <p>In the 2016 article, Policy and the Internet of Things, it is highlighted how a lack of regulation and government standardising could lead to significant security flaws. Because many devices use cheap sensors, backdoors are created which can be abused for data collection, the stealing of personal information, and listening through device microphones. (Costigan and Lindstrom, 2016) This poses the questions regarding whose responsibility it is to keep data safe, the manufacturer or the user? While the manufacturer has the obligation to ensure devices are kept up-to-date and as secure as possible, the user must ensure that they take precautions to ensure that no sensitive information is transferred through these devices if they feel that there is a risk.</p>
          <p>Home assistants like Google Home and Amazon Alexa have often been accused of "spying" - listening in on the user. This stems from the fact that the devices constantly listen for key phrases such as "Ok Google" or "Alexa". While Google and Amazon claim that the recordings are deleted, Google actually logs all user data indefinitely to create targeted advertising. (Anderson, 2010)</p>
          <p>In 2015, Samsung came under fire for revealing that their televisions kept all the conversations heard to the point that the Privacy Policy advised that "…if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party…" while in 2016, it was revealed that the US government was petitioning companies to give access to cameras, microphones and data collected by IoT devices.(Timm, 2016) This, alongside the 2015 incident, suggests that society is travelling the path of an Orwellian nightmare.</p>
          <p>Security issues don't just come from within the companies, as IoT devices are typically unsecure and thus easily hacked. Last year, 10 GB of data was stolen from a casino through a IoT connected fish tank monitor. The hackers gained access to the casinos network through the computer the monitor was connected to. (Schiffer, 2017)</p>
        <h3>Data Collection and Sale</h3>
          <h4>"Surveillance is the business model of the internet"</h4>
            <h5 class="quote">- Bruce Schneier</h5>
            <!--Insert the BBC infographic on the right -->
              <p>Google is an advertising company. Almost 75% of their 2016 revenue was made from web advertising worth $67.4 Billion USD. (Cellan-Jones, 2017) They use targeted advertising based on previous search results to make ads more relevant and therefore more likely to attract an audience. Facebook was in the news recently for selling data. While Mark Zuckerberg denies this, he instead claims that Facebook stores all user data and advertisers request to have ads shown on the pages of people with particular interests. For example, a Facebook might show people with an interest in cars a new car advert.</p>
              <p>With the rise of Internet of Things, it becomes more necessary than ever to ensure that data is secure and deleted once it has served its purpose. Big companies such as Google or Amazon have a moral obligation to ensure that customers are protected and not abused for profit. It is in the companies best interests to protect customers from data breeches and sale. This is best done by encrypting data from end-to-end so that not even the companies know what the data says. (Horne, 2017)</p>
              <!-- Link to Mycroft Kickstarter -->
              <p>People can protect themselves from excess data collection by reading the privacy policies and terms of conditions of products to ensure that they are not being scammed out of data. Alternatively, they can invest in open-source IoT software such as Mycroft which is a Kickstarted home assistant with a privacy focus.</p>
        <h3>Compatability - Closed Ecosystems</h3>
        <!-- At the right a box w/ A closed ecosystem occurs when a company's products are only fully compatible with other products by said company -->
          <p>Companies like Apple are notorious for their closed ecosystem. This is an anti-consumer practice which will be difficult to continue to implement into the future with many new tech companies appearing every year, with Analyst Andrew Bartels predicting a 4% growth, worth about $3 Trillion USD in 2018. A .6% rise from 2017 estimates of 3.6% (Bartels, 2017) If companies do not open their ecosystems, their consumers will potentially become unable to fully integrate into the IoT. (Charged, 2018)</p>

      <h2>Consequences</h2>
        <p>If we continue to ignore standardisation and allow significant security flaws to exist, we risk a new era of espionage and data theft on a level not yet seen. While a rouge hacker can steal from your computer currently, we risk mass attacks on entire buildings which can potentially even allow physical theft. Security expert Matthew Garrett used a networking tool to control IoT connected lights, televisions, curtains and even doors within a hotel by unplugging a tablet-based light hitch and plugging in his laptop. Garrett's example highlights the new crimes which will arise within unsecured networks. (Vaughan-Nichols, 2016)</p>
      <h3>What can be done?</h3>
        <p>The simplest thing we can do to ensure a safer IoT experience is to keep devices updated with the latest security patches and ensure that your networks are secure. Ensure that you use encryption techniques such as end-to-end encryption, in which the data is only readable by the device receiving/transmitting information, (Morse, 2017) and only buying products that need to be connected to the internet, because by reducing the number of items you have connected, there are less points of weakness</p>
